Prime Gold Calculator
This is a handy calculator for the Math Pentathlon game "Prime Gold".  In the game, players
roll 3 dice (2 20 sided, 1 12 sided), and can place tokens on a game board based on some math
that they can do.  Any operator (+,-,*,/,!) can be used, and in any combination of the die
rolls.  This calculator shows what moves are possible for any given roll.

To use, enter the 3 die rolls.  The check is just that they are 1-20, just use any field for the 
12-sided die.  Hit submit, and 3 things will happen:  A list of valid sentences will print below the board,
valid solutions will color green on the game board, and if you have entered a target value, that 
solution (if available) will be highlighted at the top of the list below the board.  On the board,
prime numbers are more valuable, and are show with rounded corners.
